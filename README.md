# Deep-Image-Ranking

Neural Networks have been used for a variety of tasks, especially using unstructured data. Neural Networks are extremely good at image recognition, image segmentation etc. Learning Fine-grained Image Similarity with Deep Ranking (https://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jwa368/pdfs/deep_ranking.pdf) is a novel application of neural networks, where the authors use a new multi scale architecture combined with a triplet loss to create a neural network that is able to perform image search.

This repository is a simpler implementation of the paper. The differences is that, the entire multi scale network has been replaced by a resnet. A simpler version of triplet sampling has been used. 

sample results from the network are as shown below :
