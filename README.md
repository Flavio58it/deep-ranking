# Deep-Image-Ranking

Neural Networks have been used for a variety of tasks, especially using unstructured data. Neural Networks are extremely good at image recognition, image segmentation etc
Learning Fine-grained Image Similarity with Deep Ranking (https://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jwa368/pdfs/deep_ranking.pdf) is a novel application of neural networks.
